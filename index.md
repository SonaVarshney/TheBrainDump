# BrainDump-CS 🧠💻

*A little corner of the internet where I dump everything I learn in tech — concepts, code snippets, random insights, and things I find cool. No structure, just pure learning chaos.*

## 👋 Hey, I’m Sona!

Just a software developer capturing stuff I learn on the way — nothing fancy, just me and my brain dump.

---

## 🌱 What’s here?

- CS concepts I pick up along the way  
- Code snippets, debugging wisdom & “oh, that’s how it works!” moments  
- Notes on system design, DSA, and whatever tech I’m exploring  
- Anything worth remembering (or forgetting and rediscovering later)  

---

## 🤷 Why?

> Because memory is unreliable, but markdown isn’t.
